/**
 * A dedicated, static route for the post-creation confirmation — not just a state inside
 * ConnectGoogleSheetsPage. Navigated to (via `navigate(..., { replace: true })`) right after
 * the destination is created, so a page refresh (or the browser restoring this tab later)
 * lands back here instead of the connect form, which would otherwise risk creating a
 * duplicate destination if "Connect with Google" were triggered again.
 *
 * Deliberately generic, with no destination title or other data taken from the URL: a query
 * param can't be trusted to reflect what was actually created (or that anything was created
 * at all), so nothing here should be treated as an authoritative confirmation of details.
