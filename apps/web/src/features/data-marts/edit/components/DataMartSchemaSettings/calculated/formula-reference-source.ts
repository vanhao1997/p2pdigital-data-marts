 * fallback would be the alias, which is the very text already on screen.
 *
 * A calculated own reference does have something to add, and it is the level: the two levels are
 * written differently, and the sentences here are the backend's own, so the refusal an analyst may
 * meet next says the same thing this did.
 *
 * Except when no save has derived that level yet, and then the honest answer is to say so. These
 * are SENTENCES, and two of the three rule something out — "cannot be wrapped". The completion
 * row's label may take the quiet guess an absent level gets everywhere else in the web, because
 * the worst a label does is under-sell one row of a menu; a sentence carrying "cannot" would tell
 * the analyst that `SUM(roas)` is illegal when it may be exactly what they need.
